# Audio Files for FocusFlow

This directory should contain audio notification files:

- `focus-complete.mp3` - Played when a focus session completes
- `break-complete.mp3` - Played when a break completes

## Where to get audio files:

1. Use free sound libraries like:
   - freesound.org
   - zapsplat.com
   - mixkit.co/free-sound-effects

2. Or create simple notification tones using online tools

## Recommended characteristics:

- Gentle, non-jarring sounds
- 1-3 seconds duration
- ADHD-friendly (calming, not alarming)
- Format: MP3, 128kbps

For now, you can proceed without audio files - the app will work but won't play sounds.
